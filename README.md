--- We created a chatbot using Amazon Lex and several Lambda functions.  You can ask the bot about crypto, transactions, expenses, and subcriptions. 

## Technologies

You must have access to AWS to use Amazon Lex for the chatbot.
Here is a link to the website where you can make a free account: https://aws.amazon.com/

Every dependency needed to run the bot is provided in each lambda function, but below are examples of required libraries that we included:

```from datetime import datetime```
```from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta```
```from botocore.vendored import requests```
```import json```
