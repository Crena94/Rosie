# Rosie 

---Rosie is a robotic personal assistant built on top of Amazon Lex's platform which allows for easy bootstrapping of chatbots with conversational AI capabilities.  Using Amazon Lambda functions and their integration with Amazon Lex, we created a chatbot with several intents at its disposal. 

## Technologies

You must have access to AWS to use Amazon Lex for the chatbot.
Here is a link to the website where you can make a free account: https://aws.amazon.com/

Every dependency needed to run the bot is provided in each lambda function, but below are examples of required libraries that we included:

```from datetime import datetime```
```from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta```
```from botocore.vendored import requests```
```import json```

## Utterances
